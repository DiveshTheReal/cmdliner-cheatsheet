# cmdliner-cheatsheet

[Cmdliner](https://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner) is a
feature-complete library for parsing the command line of an OCaml
program. It supports long options, short options, subcommands, and custom
argument formats like you've always wanted. The output of `--help`
is similar to a man page, see for example `opam --help`.
Cmdliner is to be used instead of the `Arg` module from the standard library.

This cheatsheet is a compact reference for common patterns.
